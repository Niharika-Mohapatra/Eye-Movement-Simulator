# Eye Movement Simulation

This visualization demonstrates two major types of human eye movements:

* **Smooth Pursuit**: where the eyes smoothly track a moving target.

* **Saccades**: rapid, jerky movements the eye makes to shift focus between points.

Built with p5.js. 

## Features:
Visual simulation of eye tracking behavior.

Custom-coded models for:

* Smooth pursuit using velocity-based motion and pursuit gain.
* Saccades using biologically inspired velocity profiles (minimum jerk).

Visual graphs:

* Velocity over time
* Amplitude vs. duration of saccades. 

Tech Stack:
* p5.js
* HTML5 Canvas
* Javascript
