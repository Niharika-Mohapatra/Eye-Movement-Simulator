        <h1>Eye Movements: Saccades and Smooth Pursuit Animations</h1>
        <p>
            Human vision is driven by rapid and dynamic eye movements. 
            Saccades are quick, ballistic jumps that redirect our gaze from one point to another, 
            allowing us to scan scenes efficiently, accompanied by fixations 
            which are brief pauses between saccades where the eyes remain relatively still, 
            enabling detailed visual processing. 
            In contrast, smooth pursuit allows our eyes to steadily track moving objects, 
            keeping them centered on the fovea â€” the area of the retina with the highest visual acuity. 
            Together, these movements are essential for scanning our environment, reading, recognizing faces, and following motion. 
            Without them, our perception would be fragmented and unstable.
